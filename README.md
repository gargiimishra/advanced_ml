Unigram analyses has been done
Passive-Aggressive classifier performs the best classification of true fake news
Feature Engineering can be improved to the model efficacy further
Deep Learning models can be applied. Since I got a decent accuracy of 99.563 so I did not do it. 
Limited public labelled dataset availability (here we have worked on a small dataset, might be overfitting)
Sentiment analyses can also be added to model.
A bigram or multigram model can be made
